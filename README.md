# TerrainSynthesis
This Repository contains some R&amp;D work for Procedural Terrain Synthesis

You will also need to download OpenFrameworks from http://openframeworks.cc/download/ to run this application

If you are just interested in the algorithm to do terrain synthesis just jump into the terrainprocessor class and whatever it references.
