# TerrainSynthesis
This Repository contains some R&amp;D work for Procedural Terrain Synthesis

You will also need to download OpenFrameworks from http://openframeworks.cc/download/ to run this application

If you are just interested in the algorithm to do terrain synthesis just jump into the terrainprocessor class and whatever it references.

To quickly test the terrainprocessor you can start the application and press '4'

There is also another utility which is disabled for now, that would let you specify height on certain cross sections and let the remaining terrain height be computed procedurally.
When enabled, you would be able to press '1' to specify which cross section you are interested and then you would press '2' to specify the height on the cross section
